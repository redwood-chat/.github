# Redwood Chat 🌲

Redwood Chat is an experimental new chat system, intended to be an open source
alternative to Discord, built on top of MLS (Messaging Layer Security, used for
end-to-end encryption) and ATProto (for identity).

It's currently in its design phase. If you're interested in participating in
the design, [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/RCxcM4x8JE)!
